      <h2>A True Creative Partner</h2>
      <p>
        <b>As an independent contractor,</b> I can help you solve creative
        problems in an intelligent, focused way — without the expense and
        complexities of working with an agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>As an independent thinker,</b> I can run with projects as a partner,
        rather than be another person to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plus, I’m often collaborating with skilled designers, developers, video
        producers, writers and more. Which means I can handpick a team for your
        specific project.
