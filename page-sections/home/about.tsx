            I look at your bigger story and who your customers are before I
            create anything. In my experience, this higher-level, strategic
            approach has always resulted in a better creative process and more
            effective results.

          <p>
            I have a degree in philosophy, spent years as a financial planner,
            went to Notre Dame Law School, was on the ground floor of new SaaS
            product and spent years at a full-service marketing agency doing
            work for regional, national, and global brands. Currently, Iâ€™m
            working from South Bend, IN for clients big and small across the
            U.S.
          </p>
          <p>
            I draw from all of these diverse experiences every day to deliver
            well-informed, creative work.
